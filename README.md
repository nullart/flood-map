### Missing streets
If your street, building or neighborhood name is missing on the map, you can add it to the basemap directly by editing [OpenStreetMap](http://tasks.openstreetmap.in/project/62). The flood map will be updated with the new street in under 10 minutes.

### Flooded Streets Data
The flooded streets layer is contributed by the public. Contributions are anonymous with no version control for the sake of simplicity.
